# Inverter Efficiency
Run 'inv_eff.mat' to load the inverter efficiency lookup table that was generated based on the analytical model of the inverter.

# Motor Efficiency
Run 'mot_eff.mat' to load the motor efficiency lookup table that was generated based on the analytical model of the motor.

# Drivecyle
Run 'drivecyle.mat' to generate the drivecycle data using which the battery capacity was estimated.

# Drivecyle Results
Run 'results_drivecycle_new.mat' to generate the time series data of the motor's torque and angular velocity over 1 drive cycle.
