# get_bat_cap.m
Generates the required battery capacity based on the time-series data of the motor's torque and angular velocity over 1 drive cycle and the inverter and motor efficiencies.

# get_bat_en_eff.m
Returns the battery's energy efficiency based on the current drawn from it.

# get_inv_inp_power.m
Generates the time-series data of the power drawn by the inverter based on the time-series data of the motor's torque and angular velocity over 1 drive cycle and the inverter and motor efficiencies.

# get_mot_inp_power.m
Generates the time-series data of the power drawn by the motor based on the time-series data of the motor's torque and angular velocity over 1 drive cycle and the inverter and motor efficiencies.
