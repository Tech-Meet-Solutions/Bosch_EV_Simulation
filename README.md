# Bosch Electric Vehicle Simulation
This repository contains IIT Bombay's solution to the Bosch EV problem statement offered in the 9th Inter IIT Tech Meet, organised by IIT Guwahati.
# Abstract
India represents the fourth largest automobile market in the world and the second-largest two-wheeler
market. It is also a country with massive dependency on oil imports, with a USD 112 billion oil import bill in
FY19. Pollution in many Indian cities has reached alarming levels. All these factors combined, make a strong
case for EV adoption in India.
