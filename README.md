# Bosch_EV_Simulation

The 'Simulation' folder contains all the Simulink models used for the various simulations performed. All the simulations are run from the corresponding MATLAB file, except for the gradeability and drive cycle simulations. These have to be run directly from Simulink.
Further instructions to run the simulations are provided in 'initiation.md'
